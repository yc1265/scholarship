This is also demonstrated in the project skeleton.\n\n\n\n\nQuarto includes (e.g., {{&lt; include _content.qmd &gt;}}) are highly recommended for modularizing and organizing your content. While optional, they offer several advantages.\nNote: You can include a .qmd file in a .ipynb file, but not vice versa.\n\n\n\nModularization: Breaking your project into smaller, reusable chunks simplifies the management of complex documents. You can work on specific sections without altering the entire project.\nReusability: Includes allow you to reuse content blocks across multiple documents, making them ideal for repetitive sections like headers or footers.\nConsistency: By using includes, you ensure uniformity across your documents. Updating an include file will automatically apply the changes wherever it’s used.\nSimplifies Collaboration: In team settings, includes allow different contributors to work on separate sections simultaneously, reducing merge conflicts and making the project easier to maintain.\nImproved Organization: Includes help keep your main files clean and focused by loading content from separate, well-organized files. This makes your project more manageable and easier to navigate."

    "text": "Quarto includes (e.g., {{&lt; include _content.qmd &gt;}}) are highly recommended for modularizing and organizing your content. While optional, they offer several advantages.\nNote: You can include a .qmd file in a .ipynb file, but not vice versa.\n\n\n\nModularization: Breaking your project into smaller, reusable chunks simplifies the management of complex documents. You can work on specific sections without altering the entire project.\nReusability: Includes allow you to reuse content blocks across multiple documents, making them ideal for repetitive sections like headers or footers.\nConsistency: By using includes, you ensure uniformity across your documents. Updating an include file will automatically apply the changes wherever it’s used.\nSimplifies Collaboration: In team settings, includes allow different contributors to work on separate sections simultaneously, reducing merge conflicts and making the project easier to maintain.\nImproved Organization: Includes help keep your main files clean and focused by loading content from separate, well-organized files. This makes your project more manageable and easier to navigate."

    "text": "We believe that the adoption of LLM tools is inevitable and will be an important skill for success in your future career. Therefore, appropriate and acceptable use of LLM tools is encouraged for this project. Use them to accelerate your workflow and learning, but not as a replacement for critical thinking and understanding. Carefully review and process their output, use them judiciously, and avoid bloating your text with LLM-generated content. Overusing these tools often degrades the quality of your work rather than enhancing it.\nRemember the following guidelines:\n\nUse common sense: If you feel like you’re doing something questionable, you probably are. A good test is to ask yourself, “Would I openly tell the professor or classmates what I’m doing right now?” If the answer is no, you’re probably doing something you shouldn’t.\nCite your LLM use cases: Always cite when and how you’ve used LLM tools. This is a requirement for the project.\nIs your use helping you grow professionally?: If your use of LLM tools is making you a more competent, efficient, and knowledgeable professional, you’re probably using them in an appropriate manner. If you’re using them as a shortcut to avoid work and gain free time, you’re using them incorrectly.\n\n\n\nALWAY CITE CONTENT OR IDEAS TAKEN FROM EXTERNAL SOURCES: e.g. websites, llm tools, papers\nALWAYS BE TRANSPARENT WHEN YOU ARE USING LLM TOOLS:\nPlease follow these guidelines:\n\nGeneral Tasks: Create and regularly update a dedicated LLM Transparency page to document how you are using LLM tools.\n\nThis page can serve as a “catch-all” for use cases that don’t involve content creation, such as reformatting your own ideas, commenting code that you wrote, or proofreading text, PDF summarization.\n\nContent Creation: If non-original content (code or text) is generated by an LLM, you must also cite it on specific pages, just like any external source.\n\nFor non-original content, always provide a citation.\nCite the LLM tool after each chunk of text or code it generates, using a BibTeX. For example1\n\n\n\n\n\nNote: Various useful non-LLM research tools can be found here at the following link\n\nTraditional research tools\n\nYou can use LLM tools for the following use cases\n\nAI research tools\nThese include\n\nre-formating text with LLM tools.\nCode explaination “describe what this code is doing in prose”\nText summarization\nProofreading\n\nchatGPT for project brainstorming\nUsing LLM tools to comment your code qualifies as an acceptible use case in this project. You can also use or code re-formatters such as black to increase the readability of your code.\n\n\n\n\n\nDO NOT use ChatGPT or other LLM tools to write large portions of your text or code.\n\n\nIf it is clear that you have used LLM tools to write large portions of your code or text, your grade will reflect this, likely in the range of 0% to 50% of the total points, depending on the quality of the work. LLM outputs still require significant polishing to fit into a well-written, cohesive narrative. If it is evident that you simply inserted large portions of LLM-generated content into your assignment without taking the time to refine it into a high-quality submission, your grade will reflect this, even if the usage does not rise to the level of plagiarism.\n\n\n\nIn extreme cases,the following actions will occur.\n\nOne-on-One Investigation: You will meet with department faculty for a thorough review of your project. You will be asked to explain your work in detail, including what specific chunks of code do, why you made certain decisions, and how you reached your conclusions.\nReferral to the Honor Council: If, during this meeting, it is determined that you do not have sufficient understanding of the content that you claimed to have created, the case will be documented and sent to the honor council.

    "text": "Remember, slow and steady wins the race\nMaking steady, incremental progress on a large project generally makes it more manageable. Rushing to throw something together under a tight deadline often turns the process into a nightmare.\n\n\n\nThis is a graduate-level class, so each project should be viewed as specifications, not simple step-by-step requirements. Graduate-level work must be creative, individualized, and of high quality. To achieve an A-level grade, you are expected to exceed the specifications and create unique, novel solutions.\nFor example: If you’re asked to build visualizations to support your data science story, you won’t be told how many or what type of visualizations to create. This is up to you, based on your data and the creativity and quality you want to demonstrate.\nWe want you to move away from expecting someone else to tell you what to do, how to do it, and how much to do. Instead, you’ll adopt a professional approach—reviewing specifications provided in the assignments, determining what’s needed to exceed expectations, and demonstrating professional excellence.\nThere are countless ways to approach the project requirements, so be creative and thoughtful. Instructions outline the minimum requirements, but exceeding them will elevate the quality of your work.\nAutonomy and Critical Thinking:\n\nIn the workplace, step-by-step instructions are rare. You’ll need to interpret broad requirements and deliver professional results. Producing high-quality, accurate work with limited guidance is a key professional skill.\nAt this stage, move away from asking, “Do I have to do XYZ?” Instead, critically analyze challenges. If something is unclear, investigate and break it down fundamentally.\n\nDeveloping problem-solving skills is crucial. While it’s important to work independently for at least 10–20 minutes, if you’re still stuck after 30 minutes, seek help. Being resourceful is important, but knowing when to ask for assistance is equally valuable.\n\n\n\n“Data science” is essentially a collection of useful computational and mathematical skills (statistics, cloud computing, machine learning, coding, etc). However, to maximize your effectiveness, these skills should be applied to a domain of interest (e.g., materials science, finance, healthcare, etc). Focusing and learning about a particular domain will help you specialize and make you more marketable.\nThat beind said, don’t worry about choosing the “perfect” domain—it’s always possible to pivot later, as many of the skills learned, such as problem-solving, critical thinking, and self-education, are transferable across all fields.\n\n\n\nImpact in science refers to the significance and influence of research, often measured by metrics like citations, impact factor of journals, and indices like h-index. These metrics reflect how widely recognized and valuable the work is within the scientific community. Such quanities are used to compare researchers and journals, and are used to determine grant funding and career opportunities.\n\nImpact Factor (IF):\n\nA measure of a journal’s influence, calculated by averaging the number of citations to articles published in the journal over the past two years.\nHigher impact factors indicate a more influential journal.\n\nNumber of Citations:\n\nThe total count of how often a researcher’s work is cited by others, reflecting its influence within the scientific community.\nMore citations generally signal broader recognition or relevance of the research.\n\nh-index:\n\nA metric that measures both productivity and citation impact. An h-index of 10 means a researcher has 10 papers each cited at least 10 times.\nHigher h-index indicates more influential and widely recognized work.\n\ni10-index:\n\nCounts the number of a researcher’s publications with at least 10 citations.\nA straightforward measure of citation impact, commonly used by Google Scholar.\n\nImportance of Citations:\n\nCitations indicate that other researchers find the work valuable for their own research, increasing its perceived credibility and impact in the field.\n\n\n\n\n\nProfessional academic or industrial research is all about discovery, improvement, and novelty. You don’t necessarily need to have a project that acheive the following, but here are some guidelines for what makes “high impact” projects:\nIn no particular order:\n\nNovel computational tools: For example, development of a new Python package to tackle a class of problem which doesn’t have an existing suitable tool.\nCreating more user-friendly tools: For example, there might be a great C++ code, but with no python analogue. Python is easier to use, so if you make a pythonic version of an existing tool, it may get higher adoption, provided it is more or less as efficient to the competitors.\nMore efficient tools or methods: Achieving something 1.25x, 2x, 10x or 10000x faster than existing methods, or creating a new code package that is more efficient than a previous one.\nNovel methods: A completely new way of doing something (e.g. new classification algorithm)\nExisting methods applied to new domains: Using established methods to solve problems in a novel domain, e.g. applying a particular classification methodology to a problem or dataset that no one has applied it to before. Extent of impact obviously depends on the importance of the domain or use-case.\nCreation of novel Data Sets: Provides well-curated, clean datasets that can be used to address important scientific questions or problems.(often more useful if there is an accompanying API)\nNew insights or phenomena: Using data analysis techniques to uncover new insights or patterns that address key questions or problems. For example, discovering overarching governing rules (e.g., differential equations) that describe some observed phenomena.\n\nSolves a Major Problem: Addresses a critical or unresolved issue in the field, offering a breakthrough or significant advancement.\n\nRobust Data and Methodology: Employs sound, validated methodologies and high-quality data to ensure credibility and reliability (i.e. doing something rigorously, correctly, and generally better than the competition).\nInterdisciplinary Impact: Influences multiple fields or areas of study, increasing the breadth of its significance.\nHigh Citation Potential: Likely to be widely cited due to its significance, relevance, and applicability across different areas.\n\nYou can, of course, have multiple of these components in a single project, which will increase its prestige.\nThis is especially true when conducting academic research. Publications need to be novel and make a unique contribution to the body of human knowledge; otherwise, they will not be highly cited or considered particularly important.\n\n\n\n80-20 Rule: This rule of thumb suggests that 80% of results come from 20% of causes. In other words, a small number of key factors drive the majority of outcomes. This principle applies to project management, where a few critical steps or decisions often determine the success of a project.\nFor example, it might take one week of steady work (30-40 hours) to complete 80% of a project, while the final 20% could take an additional four weeks.\n\nProjects tend to expand to fill the time available. No creative project—whether a book, song, poem, or paper—is ever truly 100% complete. There is an asymptotic limit as \\(t \\rightarrow \\infty\\), and true perfection is unattainable. The key is knowing when to “call it done.” This might happen at 95% or 99% completion, but eventually, we all have to stop. Strive to take this project as far as possible, but remember to stop and “call it done” at some point.\n\n\n\n\nVisualizations are a critical component of your portfolio. Use them strategically to support your narrative. The more visual representations of your data, the better—higher-quality visualizations will result in a higher grade. Ensure that all graphics follow best practices:\n\nChoose the right chart type: Match the chart to the data (e.g., bar for categories, line for trends).\nMaintain simplicity: Avoid clutter and focus on the essential message.\nUse appropriate scales: Ensure axes have correct and intuitive scaling to avoid misinterpretation.\nLabel axes clearly: Include meaningful axis labels with units (e.g., “Temperature (°C)” or “Revenue (USD)”).\nInclude descriptive titles: Provide a concise, informative title that explains the visualization’s main takeaway.\nEnsure consistency: Use uniform color schemes, fonts, and styles across all charts in a presentation.\nHighlight key data: Use contrasting colors or annotations to draw attention to important points or trends.\nKeep proportions accurate: Maintain correct data-to-visual size relationships to avoid distortion.\nConsider the audience: Tailor the level of detail and style to the audience’s technical proficiency.\nTest readability: Ensure fonts, colors, and elements are clear and legible in various formats and sizes.\nUse interactivity carefully: Interactive features should add clarity, not complexity, to the visual.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhile not required, practice is highly beneficial. It’s also a good habit to write your code from scratch, as this will build your problem-solving skills. You can use the code provided by professors as a reference, but always strive to write your own. Starting with a blank page is a valuable practice.\nTo get comfortable with the methods, review and modify the R and Python codes provided in class. Try applying these to your project data and experiment with creating small toy datasets, such as a CSV file or a text corpus. This helps you understand the structure of the data and what the algorithms are doing.\n\n\n\nIf you have big data, ALWAYS prototype on a small subset of the data, so that your code runs fast so that you can develop quickly, without waiting several minutes for each code cell to run. Do this by including a downsampling hyper-parameter at the beginning of your code, e.g. 0.1. When the code is robust and finalized, you can set the downsampling factor to 1, run it on the complete data set, and let your computer run overnight.\nIt is not a crazy idea to do a “trial run” of the project first from start to finish with a very basic dataset, e.g. penguins,diabetes, or iris. Make sure the “toy” data set is similar to your planned real world data set, for example, if you are planning an NLP project, don’t use a image dataset for your development process.\nThis will have the following benefits:\n\nClarifies Workflow: Understand the complete process from start to finish.\nIdentifies Challenges: Spot potential issues early on.\nValidates Assumptions: Ensure methods and approaches are suitable.\nEnhances Skills: Improve technical skills through practice.\nBuilds Confidence: Familiarity with tools and techniques.\nRefines Methods: Test and optimize analytical strategies.\nEstimates Resources: Better planning for time and resource allocation.\nFacilitates Communication: Clearly convey project goals and outcomes.\nDocuments Process: Create a reference for reproducibility.\nGathers Early Feedback: Obtain input for adjustments before full implementation.\n\nhttps://scikit-learn.org/1.5/datasets/toy_dataset.html\nOnce that is working as a starter code-base you can swap it out for your full data later and start developing further for a more realistic real world project .\n\n\n\n\n\nAlways remember the following Debugging Steps:\n\nStep A: Copy the error message and search it online (Google or similar).\nStep B: Look through forums or documentation to find a solution.\nStep C: Implement the solution.\nStep D: If you’re still stuck, ask for help from classmates, TAs, or professors.\nStep E: Move on to the next issue and repeat the process.\n\n\n(Note: You can also use ChatGPT for debugging, but be cautious as the solutions may sometimes be inaccurate or incomplete.)"

You can reuse content from previous assignments.\nYou can include the content here or on a separate page.\n\nIt’s recommended to create one “About You” page for all DSAN projects, with links to your various class projects.\n\n\n\n\nCreate a Landing Page for Your Project\n\nSummarize your topic, its significance, related work, and the questions you plan to explore.\nDraft an introduction with at least 5 research questions. These may evolve as your project progresses, since data science is an iterative process.\nInclude your data science questions on this page.\n\n\n\nLiterature review\nOnce you decide on a topic, you should ALWAYS START WITH A LITERATURE REVIEW, this is particularly important for academic projects.\nThe literature review is the most important part of most projects.\nIt allows you to;\n\n\nDetermine what is already known and what has already been tried, so that you don't re-invent the wheel.\n\n\nIt makes you more of a subject matter expert, allowing you to ask the right questions, target impactful projects, and communicate with other professionals.\n\n\n\nDoing a project that you think will change the world, only to find at the end that a very similar version of your project was already done in the 1980’s, isn’t a great use of time.\n\nIn this section, please do a literature review and cite at least 3 academic publications per group member, and include internal academic citations.\nOptional: Consider using LLM tools to 10X your literature review, e.g. instead of focusing on 3 papers, aim for 30 or more\nBy following these steps, you can 10X the efficiency of your literature review process, gaining more insights while minimizing the time spent on manual reading.\n\nExpand Your Literature Search\nAim to gather a larger pool of papers. Use academic databases (Google Scholar, arXiv, etc.) to find relevant studies and ensure a broad scope.\nSkim the Abstracts\nRead the abstracts of each paper to quickly understand their focus and identify those most relevant to your topic. Prioritize these papers for deeper analysis.\nUse LLM Tools for Summarization\nUpload the selected papers to an LLM tool capable of text summarization. Have it condense the main points of each paper into a concise, manageable summary (e.g., condense hundreds of pages into a 10-page summary). Carefully review this summary to absorb the key insights.\nLeverage Interactive LLM Tools\nUse tools like NotebookLM or other AI-based text digesters to ask specific, targeted questions about the papers:\n\nExample questions:\n\n“In the papers uploaded, did any of them explore XYZ?”\n“Which paper is most closely related to the following project idea: [explain idea]?” These tools will help you quickly extract relevant information without re-reading entire papers."

They prioritize high-level insights, actionable results, and visualizations that convey the impact of data without requiring an understanding of complex methods. For instance, a CEO may want to know how a model affects business strategy or revenue, without diving into the underlying technical details.\n\nIn this project you will cater to both audiences.

To achieve an A-level grade, you are expected to exceed the specifications and create unique, novel solutions.\nFor example: If you’re asked to build visualizations to support your data science story, you won’t be told how many or what type of visualizations to create. This is up to you, based on your data and the creativity and quality you want to demonstrate.\nWe want you to move away from expecting someone else to tell you what to do, how to do it, and how much to do. Instead, you’ll adopt a professional approach—reviewing specifications provided in the assignments, determining what’s needed to exceed expectations, and demonstrating professional excellence.\nThere are countless ways to approach the project requirements, so be creative and thoughtful. Instructions outline the minimum requirements, but exceeding them will elevate the quality of your work.\nAutonomy and Critical Thinking:\n\nIn the workplace, step-by-step instructions are rare. You’ll need to interpret broad requirements and deliver professional results. Producing high-quality, accurate work with limited guidance is a key professional skill.\nAt this stage, move away from asking, “Do I have to do XYZ?” Instead, critically analyze challenges. If something is unclear, investigate and break it down fundamentally.\n\nDeveloping problem-solving skills is crucial. While it’s important to work independently for at least 10–20 minutes, if you’re still stuck after 30 minutes, seek help.

You don’t necessarily need to have a project that acheive the following, but here are some guidelines for what makes “high impact” projects:\nIn no particular order:\n\nNovel computational tools: For example, development of a new Python package to tackle a class of problem which doesn’t have an existing suitable tool.\nCreating more user-friendly tools: For example, there might be a great C++ code, but with no python analogue. Python is easier to use, so if you make a pythonic version of an existing tool, it may get higher adoption, provided it is more or less as efficient to the competitors.\nMore efficient tools or methods: Achieving something 1.25x, 2x, 10x or 10000x faster than existing methods, or creating a new code package that is more efficient than a previous one.\nNovel methods: A completely new way of doing something (e.g. new classification algorithm)\nExisting methods applied to new domains: Using established methods to solve problems in a novel domain, e.g. applying a particular classification methodology to a problem or dataset that no one has applied it to before. Extent of impact obviously depends on the importance of the domain or use-case.\nCreation of novel Data Sets: Provides well-curated, clean datasets that can be used to address important scientific questions or problems.(often more useful if there is an accompanying API)\nNew insights or phenomena: Using data analysis techniques to uncover new insights or patterns that address key questions or problems. For example, discovering overarching governing rules (e.g., differential equations) that describe some observed phenomena.\n\nSolves a Major Problem: Addresses a critical or unresolved issue in the field, offering a breakthrough or significant advancement.\n\nRobust Data and Methodology: Employs sound, validated methodologies and high-quality data to ensure credibility and reliability (i.e. doing something rigorously, correctly, and generally better than the competition).\nInterdisciplinary Impact: Influences multiple fields or areas of study, increasing the breadth of its significance.\nHigh Citation Potential: Likely to be widely cited due to its significance, relevance, and applicability across different areas.\n\nYou can, of course, have multiple of these components in a single project, which will increase its prestige.\nThis is especially true when conducting academic research. Publications need to be novel and make a unique contribution to the body of human knowledge; otherwise, they will not be highly cited or considered particularly important."

The more visual representations of your data, the better—higher-quality visualizations will result in a higher grade. Ensure that all graphics follow best practices:\n\nChoose the right chart type: Match the chart to the data (e.g., bar for categories, line for trends).\nMaintain simplicity: Avoid clutter and focus on the essential message.\nUse appropriate scales: Ensure axes have correct and intuitive scaling to avoid misinterpretation.\nLabel axes clearly: Include meaningful axis labels with units (e.g., “Temperature (°C)” or “Revenue (USD)”).\nInclude descriptive titles: Provide a concise, informative title that explains the visualization’s main takeaway.\nEnsure consistency: Use uniform color schemes, fonts, and styles across all charts in a presentation.\nHighlight key data: Use contrasting colors or annotations to draw attention to important points or trends.\nKeep proportions accurate: Maintain correct data-to-visual size relationships to avoid distortion.\nConsider the audience: Tailor the level of detail and style to the audience’s technical proficiency.\nTest readability: Ensure fonts, colors, and elements are clear and legible in various formats and sizes.\nUse interactivity carefully: Interactive features should add clarity, not complexity, to the visual."

    "text": "Coding\n\nPractice First\nWhile not required, practice is highly beneficial. It’s also a good habit to write your code from scratch, as this will build your problem-solving skills. You can use the code provided by professors as a reference, but always strive to write your own. Starting with a blank page is a valuable practice.\nTo get comfortable with the methods, review and modify the R and Python codes provided in class. Try applying these to your project data and experiment with creating small toy datasets, such as a CSV file or a text corpus. This helps you understand the structure of the data and what the algorithms are doing.\n\n\nPrototype and develop on a small data set\nIf you have big data, ALWAYS prototype on a small subset of the data, so that your code runs fast so that you can develop quickly, without waiting several minutes for each code cell to run. Do this by including a downsampling hyper-parameter at the beginning of your code, e.g. 0.1. When the code is robust and finalized, you can set the downsampling factor to 1, run it on the complete data set, and let your computer run overnight.\nIt is not a crazy idea to do a “trial run” of the project first from start to finish with a very basic dataset, e.g. penguins,diabetes, or iris. Make sure the “toy” data set is similar to your planned real world data set, for example, if you are planning an NLP project, don’t use a image dataset for your development process.\nThis will have the following benefits:\n\nClarifies Workflow: Understand the complete process from start to finish.\nIdentifies Challenges: Spot potential issues early on.\nValidates Assumptions: Ensure methods and approaches are suitable.\nEnhances Skills: Improve technical skills through practice.\nBuilds Confidence: Familiarity with tools and techniques.\nRefines Methods: Test and optimize analytical strategies.\nEstimates Resources: Better planning for time and resource allocation.\nFacilitates Communication: Clearly convey project goals and outcomes.\nDocuments Process: Create a reference for reproducibility.\nGathers Early Feedback: Obtain input for adjustments before full implementation.\n\nhttps://scikit-learn.org/1.5/datasets/toy_dataset.html\nOnce that is working as a starter code-base you can swap it out for your full data later and start developing further for a more realistic real world project ."

While optional, they offer several advantages.\nNote: You can include a .qmd file in a .ipynb file, but not vice versa.\n\nWhy Use Quarto Includes?\n\nModularization: Breaking your project into smaller, reusable chunks simplifies the management of complex documents. You can work on specific sections without altering the entire project.\nReusability: Includes allow you to reuse content blocks across multiple documents, making them ideal for repetitive sections like headers or footers.\nConsistency: By using includes, you ensure uniformity across your documents. Updating an include file will automatically apply the changes wherever it’s used.\nSimplifies Collaboration: In team settings, includes allow different contributors to work on separate sections simultaneously, reducing merge conflicts and making the project easier to maintain.\nImproved Organization: Includes help keep your main files clean and focused by loading content from separate, well-organized files. This makes your project more manageable and easier to navigate."

You will be asked to explain your work in detail, including what specific chunks of code do, why you made certain decisions, and how you reached your conclusions.\nReferral to the Honor Council: If, during this meeting, it is determined that you do not have sufficient understanding of the content that you claimed to have created, the case will be documented and sent to the honor council.

It provides a thorough overview of the dataset, highlights patterns, identifies potential issues, and prepares the data for further analysis. Follow these instructions to document your EDA effectively:\nThe goal of EDA is to gain a deeper understanding of the dataset and its relevance to your project’s objectives. It involves summarizing key data characteristics, identifying patterns, anomalies, and preparing for future analysis phases.\nHere are suggestions for things to include on this page\nUnivariate Analysis:\n\nNumerical Variables:\n\nProvide summary statistics (mean, median, standard deviation).\nVisualize distributions using histograms or density plots.\n\nCategorical Variables:\n\nPresent frequency counts and visualize distributions using bar charts or pie charts.\n\nKey Insights:\n\nHighlight any notable trends or patterns observed.\n\n\nBivariate and Multivariate Analysis:\n\nCorrelation Analysis:\n\nAnalyze relationships between numerical variables using a correlation matrix.\nVisualize with heatmaps or pair plots and discuss any strong correlations.\n\nCrosstabulations:\n\nFor categorical variables, use crosstabs to explore relationships and visualize them with grouped bar plots.\n\nFeature Pairings:\n\nAnalyze relationships between key variables, particularly those related to your target.\nVisualize with scatter plots, box plots, or violin plots.\n\n\nData Distribution and Normalization:\n\nSkewness and Kurtosis:\nAnalyze and discuss the distribution of variables.\nApply transformations (e.g., log transformation) if needed for skewed data.\nNormalization:\nApply normalization or scaling techniques (e.g., min-max scaling, z-score).\nDocument and visualize the impact of normalization.\n\nStatistical Insights:\n\nConduct basic statistical tests (e.g., T-tests, ANOVA, chi-square) to explore relationships between variables.\nSummarize the statistical results and their implications for your analysis.\n\nData Visualization and Storytelling:\n\nVisual Summary:\nPresent key insights using charts and visualizations (e.g., Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly).\nEnsure all visualizations are well-labeled and easy to interpret.\nInteractive Visualizations (Optional):\nInclude interactive elements (e.g., Plotly, Bokeh) to allow users to explore the data further.\n\nConclusions and Next Steps:\n\nSummary of EDA Findings:\nHighlight the main takeaways from the EDA process (key trends, patterns, data quality issues).\nImplications for Modeling:\nDiscuss how your EDA informs the next steps in your project (e.g., feature selection, data transformations).\nOutline any further data cleaning or preparation required before moving into modeling."

This section can be included here, or you can make a new page in the dropdown menu for it.\nPlease break this page into a “regression” section, “binary classification” section, and a “Multi-class classification” section. For each case you should try multiple methods, including those discussed in class, and compare and contrast their preformance and results."
